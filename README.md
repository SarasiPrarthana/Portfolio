# Portfolio Website

This is the development branch for my personal portfolio website.  
It showcases my skills, projects, and creative work in a clean, modern UI.

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Overview
- **Bold Black Theme** â€“ Elegant and professional look
- **Large White Main Name** â€“ Strong first impression
- **Orange Handwritten Subtitle** â€“ Adds a personal and creative touch
- **Centered Profile Image** â€“ Cut-out style for a modern intro section
- **Responsive Layout** â€“ Adapts to desktop and mobile screens

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** â€“ Structure
- **CSS3** â€“ Styling and layout
- (JavaScript will be added for interactivity in later stages)

## ðŸ“Œ Branch Info

Main branch will only be updated once features are tested and finalized.
